# jekyll-hardlinks

Jekyll copies static files and duplicates storage use. Hard links point
to the same file instead of making copies, thus saving storage.

**This plugin only works on file systems that support hard links.**  It
will fallback to copying files if you're generating the site in another
filesystem, since cross-filesystem hard links aren't possible.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-hardlinks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-hardlinks

## Usage

Add early on your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
- jekyll-hardlinks
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create
a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the
`.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
